<p>I am a researcher, project manager, <a href="/writing-editing/">writer, and editor</a> living in Decatur, Georgia. Recently, I have been focused on improving my data science skills, including statistical analysis and programming in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. Follow along with my progress on my <a href="/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to moving to Georgia, I spent five years as a project manager at the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung’s New York office. RLS is a democratic socialist political education foundation closely affiliated with Germany’s Left Party. My primary responsibilities concerned socio-ecological transformation, particularly in relationship to the Global South, but I also worked on a variety of issues of concern to the European and North American Left.</p>
<p>My educational background is in South Asian religious studies and culminated in a PhD from Columbia University. Read more about my dissertation and scholarly publications on my <a href="/research/">research</a> page.</p>
