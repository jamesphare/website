I am an aspiring data scientist and religious studies PhD living in Decatur, Georgia. I am an experienced researcher, writer, editor, teacher, and project manager.

Prior to moving to Georgia, I spent five years as a project manager at the [Rosa Luxemburg Stiftungâ€™s New York office](https://rosalux.nyc/). RLS is an an internationally operating, progressive non-profit institution for civic education with 24 regional offices around the world and special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. My primary responsibilities concerned socio-ecological transformation, particularly in relationship to the Global South.

My educational background is in South Asian religious studies and culminated in a PhD from Columbia University. Read more about my dissertation and scholarly publications on my [research](/research/) page.
