This week's [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-10-27/readme.md) provides data on wind turbines across Canada. Seems like it would be fun (and perhaps informative) to make a map!

```{r}

wind_projects <- wind_turbine %>% 
        group_by(project_name) %>% 
        summarise(longitude = mean(longitude),
                  latitude = mean(latitude),
                  province_territory = province_territory,
                  total_project_capacity_mw = total_project_capacity_mw) %>% 
        distinct()

wind_projects_sf <- st_as_sf(wind_projects, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"))
st_crs(wind_projects_sf) <- 4326
```
               
```{r}
ggplot() +
        geom_sf(data = canada, mapping = aes(geometry = geometry)) +
        geom_sf(data = wind_projects_sf, mapping = aes(size = total_project_capacity_mw,
                                                       color = province_territory),
                alpha = .4) +

             size = "Total Project Capacity\n(Megawatts)"
