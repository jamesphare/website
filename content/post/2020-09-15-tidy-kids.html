<p>This week’s <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/275a2313a8d8536cb6d43d9fcb2ee232a792b22c/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md">Tidy Tuesday</a> takes a look the Urban Institute’s data on public spending on children from 1997 to 2016. I decided to narrow my focus to pre-k to 12 education spending and to look at the percentage change over this period in per-child spending, adjusted for inflation. This information would probably be best suited to a bar plot, but I wanted to learn how to make hex tile maps!
