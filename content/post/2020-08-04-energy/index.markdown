I created this map of modern renewable (wind and solar) electricity generation in Europe as part of this weekâ€™s [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-08-04/readme.md). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/jamesphare/website/blob/master/content/post/2020-08-04-energy/index.Rmarkdown).
