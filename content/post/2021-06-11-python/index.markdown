I've started learning Python, so I decided to apply some of my newly developing skills to this [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-18/readme.md) from a few weeks ago. The data come from the Ask a Manager Survey, which includes earnings information from more than 24,000 self-selecting survey respondents.

The respondents are non-random and skew heavily toward white women in professional jobs in the United States.

While exploring the data, I found, unsurprisingly, that formal education and years of experience in a field seem to have a profound effect on compensation. I decided to visualize these relationships in a heat map.

Source code, in Python this time, available on [GitHub]().
