This week's [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/fef6e442ac38e55edbdd91c1c19736f5ccdb9579/data/2020/2020-09-01/readme.md) presented *a lot* of data with many potential stories to tell. I decided to narrow in on grain production in the United States. I also decided to Americanize names and measurements because who really knows what tonnes of maize per hectare means? I used Commonwealth spellings in the code (which is available [here](https://github.com/jamesphare/website/blob/master/content/post/2020-09-01-global-crop-yields/index.Rmarkdown)) just to be inconsistent.
