It's important to add alt text to images in order to make them accessible to users of screen readers. 

I compose this blog using the excellent [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package, which enables me to easily include code-generated plots. Yesterday, I decided to finally figure out how to add alt text to these plots. I'm sharing what I learned in order to help others in the R community make their visualizations more accessible and as a reminder to myself.

For still images, alt text can be added using markdown syntax (or the "insert image" menu option, under "Addins"): `![Informative text](image.jpg)`

Another way to add alt text to images is to use [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/). In markdown, these codes can be used as is. So `{{%/* figure src="image.jpg" alt="Informative text" */%}}` would render a figure with accompanying alt text in a markdown document.

In rmarkdown documents, Hugo shortcodes won't render directly, so it is necessary to use the shortcode function from the blogdown package:

`blogdown::shortcode("figure", src = "image.jpg", alt = "Informative text")
`

So that works for static images, but how about code-generated plots? In these cases, we can save the output then use the shortcode to display it with an appropriate alt text.

But what about code-generated plots? In this case, we can generate and save a static image then add the alt text using the above method. It's a small extra step but worth it to improve accesibility.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapminder <- gapminder

gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
        filter(year == 2007)

gapminder_image <- ggplot(gapminder) + 
        geom_point(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent), alpha = 0.5) +
        theme_minimal() +
        labs(title = "Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita in 2007",
             caption = "Source: Gapminder\njamesphare.org",
             x = "GDP per Capita",
             y = "Life Expectancy",
             color = "Continent",
             size = "Population") +
        scale_size(labels = scales::comma) +
        scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)

ggsave("images/gapminder_image.jpg", plot = gapminder_image)
```
