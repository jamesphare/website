As part of the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/70f22df34ec00013b0b27bea143e871426638521/data/2020/2020-07-14/readme.md) project, I created this visualization of who has gone into space based on gender and nationality. This is my first attempt at mapping data geographically! Iâ€™m pretty pleased with how it turned out, but I would welcome any feedback. The code is available [here](https://github.com/jamesphare/website/blob/master/content/post/2020-07-14-tidy-astronauts/index.Rmarkdown).
