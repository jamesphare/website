![Plot of where astronauts come from by country and gender](/post/2020-08-19-tidy-astronauts_files/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

As part of the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/70f22df34ec00013b0b27bea143e871426638521/data/2020/2020-07-14/readme.md) project, I created this visualization of who has gone into space based on gender and nationality. This is my first attempt at mapping data geographically! Iâ€™m pretty pleased with how it turned out, but I would welcome any feedback. The code is available [here](https://github.com/jamesphare/tidytuesday/blob/4558c9e0535d177b7e60483d4f4cdaf23f235532/20200714/astronauts.md).
