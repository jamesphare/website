This week's [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-04/readme.md) uses data from [Water Point Data Exchange](https://data.waterpointdata.org/dataset/Water-Point-Data-Exchange-WPDx-Basic-/jfkt-jmqa), an organization which gathers water point data from various sources with the goal of improving water access for millions of people.

This week I decided to take a different approach than usual and not use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Instead, I used [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive map of water sources in Madagascar with information about each source visible as a popup.

```{r map}
leaflet(data = water_madagascar) %>% 
        addTiles() %>% #OpenStreetMap base map
        addTiles(attribution = "Source: Water Point Data Exchange") %>% 
        addMarkers(lat = ~lat_deg, lng = ~lon_deg,
                   clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
                   popup = ~content)
```
